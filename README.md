![Aerosol Icon](extension/icon128.png)

**Aerosol** is a Chrome extension that visualizes air pollution in a way everyone understands ― cigarettes! [Download now](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jkkedagbmggnopjjjjodahkbpmolidje?utm_source=item-share-cb) from the Chrome Web Store, or [directly download the zip](https://github.com/raghav-karn/aerosol/releases/latest/download/aerosol.zip). *By using Aerosol, you acknowledge that you have read and understood [our Privacy Policy](https://aerosol.raghavkarn.com/privacy-policy).*

> [!WARNING]
> Although AQI and Equivalent Cigarettes data gives a wider view, the reliability of data is up to OpenWeatherMap and Aerosol's limited Equivalent Cigarette count algorithm. There may be some degree of discrepancy and error when compared to other sources.

>[!CAUTION]
> Since Aerosol's results might differ from other sources, kindly take it with a grain of salt. The extension is meant to provide an overview of Air Quality of a particular city to get the gist of it. Aerosol is not meant for any precise measurement of Air Quality Index or Equivalent Cigarettes count.

## 🤔 What's This All About?

Ever wondered how bad the air pollution in your city really is? Air Quality Index (AQI) numbers can be abstract and hard to grasp. **Aerosol** translates these numbers into something more tangible - the equivalent number of cigarettes you're "smoking" just by breathing the air.
