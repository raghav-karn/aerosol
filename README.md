# 🌬️ Aerosol 🚬

![Aerosol Icon](extension/icon128.png)

**Aerosol** is a Chrome extension that visualizes air pollution in a way everyone understands - cigarettes!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although AQI and Equivalent Cigarettes data gives a wider view, the reliability of data is up to OpenWeatherMap. There may be some degree of discrepancy and error when compared to other sources.

## 🤔 What's This All About?

Ever wondered how bad the air pollution in your city really is? Air Quality Index (AQI) numbers can be abstract and hard to grasp. **Aerosol** translates these numbers into something more tangible - the equivalent number of cigarettes you're "smoking" just by breathing the air.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **AQI Search for cities**: Look up for the AQI of any city arounf the world!
- 📊 **Cigarettes counter**: See the equivalent "cigarette count" of the AQI of any city.
- 🌎 **Global Coverage**: Works with AQI data from basically all the cities. Thanks, OpenWeatherMap API.

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

Aerosol uses peer-reviewed research from the University of California, Berkeley that established the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cigarette smoking:

> "One cigarette is equivalent to an air pollution PM2.5 of 22 μg/m³ for 24 hours"

We use this formula along with current AQI readings to calculate your "cigarette exposure" from ambient air pollution.

## 💡 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Toggle the extension

## 🙋‍♀️ FAQs

### Is this scientifically accurate?
I mean, if you trust Claude then yeah. The calculated data seems a bit off from what other calculators do (with an avg discrepancy of around 0.5 cigarettes). There is a discrepancy of 10-40 AQI too, when compared to other sources. This is also on Claude.

### Does this work everywhere?
Aerosol works in any location covered by our air quality data providers, which includes most major cities worldwide.

### How often is the data updated?
As often OpenWeatherMaps wills to update it.
